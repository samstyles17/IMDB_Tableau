IMDB top 1000 movie dataset analysis and visualization using Tableau

Here, I have used Tableau visualization to analyze the dataset based on IMDB's top 1000 movies dataset available in the Kaggle repository.
Link for the dataset - [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows)

The dashboard has been published on Tableau Public - [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/harsh.singh5765/viz/IMDBAnalysis_16980672780060/IMDBDashboard?publish=yes](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/harsh.singh5765/viz/IMDBAnalysis_16980672780060/IMDBDashboard?publish=yes)

Following are the screenshots  of the work -
